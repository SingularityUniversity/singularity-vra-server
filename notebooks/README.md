# Using the Notebooks

## Setup
All of the notebooks should work with an Anaconda installation.  Otherwise, create a virtual env and install the packages in requirements.txt.  Note: see http://help.pythonanywhere.com/pages/IPythonNotebookVirtualenvs for using Jupyter in a virtualenv.

## Notebooks
1. Category_Extract.ipynb

    Creates a graph of categories based on wikipedia topics.  Requires setting up 
    a database with a dump of the wikipedia topics.  Used in creating an 
    ontology of categories for the articles processed by the server.

2. Graph_Stats.ipynb

    Calculates some basic stats about the graph generated by the Category Extract
    notebook.

3. tfidf_vra_corpus.ipynb

    An experiment in using the ontology graph and tf-idf to categorize articles
    processed by the server.  The resulting approach is implemented in the 
    server to generate categories for each article.

4. ProviderVsContentURLs.ipynb

    An experiment looking at which publishers provide the majority articles from
    the feeds.
